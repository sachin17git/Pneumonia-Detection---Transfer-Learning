# Pneumonia Detection using Transfer Learning.
## Performing both Convnet Fine Tuning and Fixed Feature Extraction.

The Dataset was taken from Kaggle. You can download it from here https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia .
###       
The objective was to predict whether the person has pneumonia or not based on his chest x-ray image. The model was trained on ResNet-50 CNN model. Both fine tuning and fixed feature extraction was performed.
